1. OpenMP warm-up
a) For the first for-loop parallel region, the first thread takes sum_1^(n/2-1)[i] ms, 
and the second thread takes sum_n/2^(n-1)[i] ms. For the second for-loop, these timings
are swapped, as the time is f(n-1). There is an implicit barrier between the parallel
regions, so in the first region, loop 1 spends sum_n/2^(n-1)[i] - sum_i^(n/2-1)[i] =
n^2/4 ms. The same goes for loop 2 in the second region, for a total of n^2/2 ms of 
waiting. Here we have assumed that n is odd, but it would be close to this for even n,
especially as it gets large.

b) If we instead use schedule(static,1), the threads will no longer take the first vs
second half, but every other value of i. This will even out the time, as the time spent
in f scales linearly with i. If n is odd, the timing should be exactly the same; if it
is even there will be slightly differences.

c) If we use schedule(dynamic,1), the threads will be given values of i in no particular
order. This will cause slight unevenness between the threads, but for large N, the times
should end up being pretty even. So no, the timing will not improve, but it will only
worsen slightly.

d) We could add "nowait" to the end of the first "#pragma omp for schedule(static)"
clause, so that the threads would not wait for each other after the first loop. Because
their workload switches in the second loop, this would overall even out the time both
spend performing the work in function f.


2. Finding OpenMP bugs
The solutions to these bugs are contained in the files omp_solved{2,3,4,5,6}.c.


3. Parallel Scan in OpenMP
I have parallelized the scan operation in omp-scan.cpp. I am running it on an Intel(R) 
Xeon(R) Platinum 8268 CPU @ 2.90GHz machine with 24 CPU cores. The timings are as follows:

n_threads     time_serial     time_parallel
1             0.395430s       0.464113s
2             0.398467s       0.251680s
4             0.396774s       0.133399s
8             0.405978s       0.077052s
16            0.396201s       0.056059s
24            0.393506s       0.070141s
32            0.400545s       0.068314s
64            0.419367s       0.057954s

We can see that we get a speedup of not quite a factor of the number of threads, but still
substantial. The speedup in parallel plateaus once we hit ~16 threads. This is a bit odd 
as we have 24 cores, but perhaps the overhead of thread splitting gets high with so
many threads.


4. OpenMP version of 2D Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel smoothing
I have implemented serial and parallel versions of these algorithms. For f(x,y)=1 and 
a maximum of 1000 iterations, we get the following timings for Jacobi (note that N=10 converges after a few hundred iters):

N    n_threads  t_jacobi_ser   t_jacobi_par   t_gs_ser   t_gs_par
10   4          0.000113s      0.001261s      0.000103s  0.000754s
100  4          0.015798s      0.007725s      0.057189s  0.008230s
1000 4          2.217761s      0.522871s      6.027021s  0.433017s
10   8          0.000095s      0.001895s      0.000060s  0.001136s
100  8          0.015773s      0.007497s      0.057202s  0.007988s
1000 8          2.206619s      0.271154s      6.021739s  0.225288s
10   16         0.000097s      0.002960s      0.000047s  0.001923s
100  16         0.015775s      0.009287s      0.057207s  0.010770s
1000 16         2.213305s      0.135518s      6.022402s  0.111380s
10   32         0.000097s      0.052429s      0.000049s  0.026982s
100  32         0.015750s      0.172288s      0.057199s  0.169707s
1000 32         2.202608s      0.467726s      6.021174s  0.339802s

We can see that the parallelization does not help for the smaller 
N, as the overhead for parallelization dominates. However when
we get to N=1000, we see a significant speedup for parallel. For
Jacobi we are getting about a factor of the number of threads
up until n_threads=16, which is the maximum. It plateaus past 24
threads because that is the number of cores. For G-S, get a 
speedup that is even larger than the number of threads for N=1000;
somehow our colored algorithm is more efficient than the regular
algorithm, even in serial (this is strange though and may indicate
a bug). Overall, we are able to achieve impressive times with 
parallelization.
