1. Greene Network Test

I use the pingpong.cpp program to test the bandwidth and 
latency on Greene. I use two CPUs on each of two nodes
(4 tasks total), and obtain the result:

proc0=0, proc1=3, Rank 2/4 running on cs062.nyu.cluster.
proc0=0, proc1=3, Rank 0/4 running on cs031.nyu.cluster.
proc0=0, proc1=3, Rank 1/4 running on cs031.nyu.cluster.
proc0=0, proc1=3, Rank 3/4 running on cs062.nyu.cluster.
pingpong latency: 5.351603e-03 ms
pingpong bandwidth: 1.213463e+01 GB/s

We can see that the procs we are pingponging between,
0 and 3, are on different nodes (0 on cs031, 3 on cs062).
We still get quite a small latency; this is because Greene
has such a good network. We also get reasonably high band-
width.

I compare this to pingponging between two processes on the 
same node, 0 and 1. I obtain the results:

proc0=0, proc1=1, Rank 0/4 running on cs031.nyu.cluster.
proc0=0, proc1=1, Rank 2/4 running on cs062.nyu.cluster.
proc0=0, proc1=1, Rank 1/4 running on cs031.nyu.cluster.
proc0=0, proc1=1, Rank 3/4 running on cs062.nyu.cluster.
pingpong latency: 3.560120e-04 ms
pingpong bandwidth: 2.444405e+01 GB/s

We can see that the latency is faster by an order of mag-
nitude, and the bandwidth is larger by a factor of two.
This makes sense because the information no longer has to 
go through the network, but rather just be passed within
the same node.
